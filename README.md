Quantum Variational Autoencoder for Anomaly Detection in Network Traffic

This repository accompanies the capstone project titled “Quantum Anomaly Detection System for Network Traffic”, developed by Saad Bara under the supervision of Dr. Fouad Mohammed Abbou during Spring 2025. The project implements a hybrid Quantum Variational Autoencoder (Q-VAE) model to detect network intrusions in the UNSW-NB15 dataset using quantum-enhanced learning.

📘 Abstract

This project presents a hybrid quantum-classical anomaly detection system using a Q-VAE model. The system is designed to learn the statistical patterns of normal network traffic and identify deviations indicative of cyber intrusions. The model leverages quantum circuits for the encoder component and classical processing for preprocessing, optimization, and inference.

The primary dataset used is UNSW-NB15, and performance is compared against classical baselines such as Random Forests and classical autoencoders. Results show that Q-VAE can achieve comparable precision and recall, validating the feasibility of quantum machine learning (QML) in cybersecurity contexts.
